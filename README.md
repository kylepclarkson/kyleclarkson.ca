# kyleclarkson.ca
The repository for my personal website. A project in of itself, it is a means for me to practice my web development skills using Python and Django on the back, and Bootstrap 5 on the front. 

View it [here](kyleclarkson.ca).

This is the third version of my website. Compared to past versions, I feel this one has found a balance between managing data statically and through a database. It uses a Postgre database to manage the blogposts with the remaining data (projects, research, contact) stored in HTML. 
This is also the first verison that is hosted through AWS services (Elastic Beanstalk, S3 buckets, RDMS, and Route 53) after I found my previous hosting platform, Linux shared hosting, was inadequate for my needs.
