A simple website that contains a static home page, blog functionality, and a research page.
The blog allows an authenicated user to create and edit blog posts via the admin page, which is
then visible to all users. 
Upon clicking a blog post, it is viewed in a details page. 
The research page lists my research publications and report. Upon clicking an item, the 
user is redirected to researchgate.com to view a pdf file of the article.
